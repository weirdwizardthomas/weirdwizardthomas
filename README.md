- 👋 Hi, I’m @weirdwizardthomas, an engineer of artificial intelligence and knowledge.
- 💼 I am open to job offers!
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, data processing and web applications to name a few!
- 🌱 I meddle with Flask, FastApi and Spring to write my own servers for my web apps. I'm an ideas man, I've got a big backlog of projects to work on.
- 📖 I'm currently learning modern Java frameworks for web applications, as well as React and TypeScript for frontend
- ⚙️ I am tinkering with my old Raspberry Pis to create simple home automation projects, coalescing my desire for tech and automation with gardening and zen.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborations, but I want to finish my open projects first!
