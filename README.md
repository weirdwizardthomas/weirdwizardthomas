- 👋 Hi, I’m @weirdwizardthomas, a Master's student of AI
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, data processing and web applications to name a few!
- 🌱 I meddle with Django & Rails to write my own servers for my web apps. I'm an ideas man, I've got a big backlog of projects to work on.
- 💞️ I’m not looking for any collaborations or job offers, I am quite busy with my studies, work & personal projects!
